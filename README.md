# Real-Time Anemia Risk Predictor

An ensemble learning-powered web application designed to diagnose anemia and estimate its likelihood based on clinical hematological and demographic parameters. A real-time interface, developed with Streamlit, predicts anemia and enables data-driven clinical decisions at the point of care. This tool empowers medical practitioners and health professionals with a decision support system (DSS) that not only predicts anemia status but also explains the reasoning behind predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations.
